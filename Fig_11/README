This document describes how to produce Figures 11 and S5 of the paper submitted to the Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to reproduce the figure 11 and S5 presented in the paper the model Arenites_Validation_Point_Sources_Confluences_Optimization.m should be run 
This requires the preparation of a spreadsheet describing the spatial configuration of sources and confluences along the main river, according to the Lagrangian coordinate system describe in the paper. The origin is the most downstream sampling point or closure of the model domain, and the spatial coordinate defines the distance of each source and confluence along the direction of steepest descent.
This file also performs the optimization of the parameter lambda and plots figure S5, representing the minimization condition for the error.
